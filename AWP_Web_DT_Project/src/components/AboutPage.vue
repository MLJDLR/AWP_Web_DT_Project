  <h1>Managing your emails</h1>
  <div class = "bcg">
    <br>Managing emails is a time-consuming task. <br>
    Did you know that an average professional receives 121 emails every day? <br> <br>
    For most working people, as much as 28% of their workweek is spent simply reading and responding to emails.
    It’s no surprise then that we are constantly overwhelmed by emails and as a result, we become less productive at work.
    But it doesn’t have to be this way. Just as you make time for yourself, set aside structured time for your emails in your schedule.
    It’s important to do this because an average worker checks their email close to 74 times daily!
    That’s a LOT of time, energy, and effort used up in doing something that doesn’t necessarily need so much mental bandwidth.
    But here’s the thing: emails might not seem as intrusive as a phone call, but they end up creating far more stress.
    As working professionals, we often worry about them, keep checking our inbox, and end up losing focus on things that actually matter.
    So, that brings us to the most fundamental strategy: allocate a fixed time every day to deal with email.
    You could do this at one stretch or schedule blocks of time throughout the day just for email.
    Ideally, avoid multitasking when you’re checking emails. That’s because when you minimize distractions and stay focused, it becomes easier to run through everything.
